# Whitepaper: SocialFi veToken Model

---
**[COMPANY NAME]** is building a **SocialFi** platform where **creators** and **fans** share real revenue from online content—rather than letting big tech capture it all. We’re combining the **long-term token mechanics** of DeFi (via a “veToken” model) with the **reach** of Web2 platforms like YouTube or Twitch. By locking our native token, fans get to **vote** on which creators deserve funding. Creators who deliver quality work earn **direct** revenue from the platform, not just from ad pennies.

Imagine **YouTube** if it let the **viewers** and **content creators** split most of the ad money **directly**—no middlemen taking huge cuts. On our platform, **fans** can buy some “points” (tokens), **lock** them for a while, and **vote** for their favorite YouTuber or artist to get a slice of the money that comes in from ads or sponsors. The fans also **get a share** of that money just for voting and being involved. This way, **everybody** benefits from good content, and no one has to rely on one big company to make all the rules.



# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background & Motivation
Social media platforms have revolutionized how we create, share, and consume content. However, centralized platforms typically capture most of the economic value—from ad revenue to user data—while content creators and communities receive a fraction of that value.

Recent attempts to tokenize the “creator-fan” relationship (e.g., friend.tech, fantasy.top) often produce short-lived hype, fueled by speculation rather than sustainable, long-term engagement. Speculation-driven platforms tend to see rapid user churn once hype fades, leaving creators and fans disillusioned.

By contrast, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects like **Velodrome**, **Curve**, and **Convex** have demonstrated effective **veToken models** (vote-escrowed token locking) that align incentives and distribute protocol value directly to engaged participants over time.

**[PROJECT NAME]** aims to bridge these concepts—combining the best of social community-building with the long-term alignment of a veToken economic model. Our goal is to empower creators, fans, and stakeholders to jointly govern and benefit from the platform’s growth, avoiding speculation-only bubbles.

# 2. Vision

## 2.1 SocialFi Done Right
- **Long-Term Alignment:** We want users (creators, fans, investors) to commit to the platform’s success, not flip tokens for quick gains.  
- **Shared Value:** If the platform generates revenue—from brand deals, advertising, NFT sales, or subscription-like services—that value should flow directly to the engaged community.  
- **Creator-Centric Tools:** Provide creators with transparent, decentralized monetization, while letting fans have a stake (and say) in the creator’s growth.

## 2.2 Key Principles
- **Decentralized Governance:**  
  - No single centralized team unilaterally decides how funds are allocated.  
  - Governance is performed by veToken holders who lock tokens to gain voting power.

- **Sustainable Incentives:**  
  - Protocol emissions (if any) and revenue streams reward long-term participation, not day trading.

- **Transparent & On-Chain:**  
  - All voting, revenue distribution, and community decisions are fully auditable on-chain.

# 3. Market Context & Inspiration

## 3.1 Lessons from friend.tech and Others
- **Speculation Over Sustainability:** friend.tech’s model rewarded rapid buy-sell cycles of “keys,” attracting speculation but creating little actual value for creators or fans.  
- **Short-Lived Hype:** Once trading volumes declined, many users lost interest.  
- **Opportunity:** A robust veModel can mitigate these issues by emphasizing locks and consistent rewards.

## 3.2 DeFi & veToken Models
- **Curve’s veCRV:** Pioneered the notion of locking tokens for up to 4 years to gain governance power and fee-sharing.  
- **Velodrome / Aerodrome:** Show how a 100% fee distribution to veToken lockers can bootstrap strong community buy-in and drive consistent protocol usage.

## 3.3 DeSoc & Composability
- Platforms like **Farcaster** (Ethereum) and **Lens** (Polygon) focus on decentralized social graphs and front-end composability.  
- Frames and Blinks allow mini-apps to integrate seamlessly with social feeds, unlocking new distribution channels for on-chain actions.  
- **[PROJECT NAME]** can leverage these approaches by enabling cross-platform interactions (e.g., bridging YouTube content, on-chain gating of perks, etc.) while maintaining a veToken-based reward engine.

---

# 4. Economic Model

## 4.1 Native Token: [TOKEN_SYMBOL]
- **ERC-20 standard**, minted at launch with a defined initial supply or emission schedule.  
- Serves as the base currency for governance, staking, and community rewards.

## 4.2 Vote-Escrowed Token (ve[TOKEN_SYMBOL])
- Users lock **[TOKEN_SYMBOL]** for a chosen duration (e.g., up to 4 years) to mint **ve[TOKEN_SYMBOL]**.  
- The longer the lock, the greater the voting power:  
  - 1 token locked for 4 years = 1 veToken  
  - 1 token locked for 1 year = 0.25 veToken  
- Lock positions can be represented as **NFTs (veNFTs)**, allowing potential transfer/sale if the user wants to exit early.

## 4.3 Fee Distribution & Rewards

**Revenue Sources:**
- Advertisement deals, brand sponsorship revenue  
- NFT marketplace fees (if integrated)  
- Subscription services / paywalled content  
- Tipping fees / microtransactions

**Weekly (or Epoch) Distribution:**
- All collected revenue flows into a **reward contract**.  
- ve[TOKEN_SYMBOL] holders vote on how to allocate rewards to **creator pools** or **community initiatives**.  
- veToken holders also receive a **proportional share of the fee pool**.

**Emissions (Optional):**
- Temporary emissions may bootstrap the ecosystem in early stages.  
- These emissions can decay over time to avoid perpetual inflation.

# 5. Key Roles & Parties

1. **Creators**  
   - YouTubers, Twitch streamers, musicians, artists, etc.  
   - Have a dedicated “creator pool” on-chain that receives votes → revenue share.

2. **Fans / Users**  
   - Enjoy the creator’s content (often still on Web2).  
   - May purchase and **lock** the platform’s token to gain **veTokens** (voting power).

3. **veToken Holders**  
   - Users who lock the native token for a specific duration (e.g., up to 4 years).  
   - Longer lock → greater voting power.  
   - Earn a portion of overall platform fees for voting.

4. **Advertisers / Sponsors**  
   - Pay the platform for ad space, sponsorships, brand placements.  
   - Revenue flows into [PROJECT NAME]’s on-chain treasury for distribution.

5. **Platform / Treasury**  
   - Smart contracts that **collect** all fees (ads, sponsorship deals, NFT minting fees, subscription revenue, etc.).  
   - Distributes these fees to **veToken holders** and **creator pools** based on community votes.

- **Bridging Web2 Content:** Integration tools for external platforms (YouTube, Twitch).

---

# 8. Example User Flow

1. **Creator Onboarding**  
   - Creators set up reward pools and profiles.  

2. **Fan Engagement**  
   - Fans lock tokens to earn ve\[TOKEN_SYMBOL].  

3. **Voting**
